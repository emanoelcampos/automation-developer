- UI synchronization activities play a crucial role by allowing the robot to pause and wait for specific UI events before proceeding with the next actions.
- Use of UI synchronization activities in an automation makes sure the automation process remains aligned with the behavior of the user interface. 
- They enable automation to adapt and respond to dynamic UI conditions, leading to accurate and reliable results.
