# What is Data Manipulation?

Data manipulation is the process of modifying, structuring, formatting, or sorting data to make it easier to read, use and manage.

## Objects, Properties and Methods

To understand data manipulation, we need to know what objects, methods and properties are.

- **Objects** are the fundamental building blocks of Visual Basic; almost everything that you do in Visual Basic involves modifying objects. A variable holds an object. For example, if Username = "John Doe", then the Username variable holds the "John Doe" String object. 

- **Properties** are attributes of an object or an aspect of its behavior. For example, the string class contains two properties: **Chars** (returns the Char object at a specified position in the current String object) and **Length** (returns the number of characters in the current String object). For example, based on the previous example, Username.Length returns 8. 

- **Methods** are actions that an object can perform. Methods often have parameters that qualify how the action is performed. For example, Username.Replace("John","Jack") returns "Jack Doe".
