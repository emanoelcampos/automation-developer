# What is Regular Expression?

Regular Expression (RegEx, or regexp) is a specific search pattern that can be used to easily match, locate and manage text. However, creating RegEx expressions may be challenging. UiPath Studio contains a RegEx builder that simplifies the creation of regular expressions.

Typical uses of RegEx include:

- Input Validation
- String Parsing
- Data Scraping
- String Manipulation
