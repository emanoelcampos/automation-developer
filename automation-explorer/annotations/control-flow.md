# What is control flow?

- It is the order in which activities are executed or evaluated in a software project.
- there are two concepts through which the control flow is carried out: the workflow layouts and the control flow statements.

1. **Workflow layouts**
- there are four predefined workflow layouts: Sequence, Flowchart, State Machine, and Global Handler
	
	- Sequences
		- the steps of a process execute in a clear sequential succession
		- decision trees are rarely used
		- activities in sequences are easier to read and maintain, and thus they're highly recommended for simple, linear workflows
		
	- Flowcharts
		- the individual activities are a bit more difficult to read and edit, but the execution flow between them is much clearer
		- for scenarios and decision mechanisms that require complex decision points and branches, it's best to use flowcharts

2. **Control flow statements**
- these are activities and methods that determine the decisions made during the execution of a workflow.Â 
	- the most common control flow statements:
		- The conditional, also known as decision-making activities, such as If, Else If, and Switch.
		- Loops such as While, Do While, and For Each.
