# Using Table Extraction

Table Extraction automates the process of extracting structured data from webpages and applications, converting it into a DataTable for efficient processing, reducing errors, and increasing the accuracy and speed of automation processes.

Table Extraction wizard provides a powerful tool for extracting structured data from tables by defining columns and selecting similar elements. 

- **Add new column**: we can define a series of similar elements to be extracted as a table column. 
- **Extract text or extract URL**: allows to extract either the text or the URL associated with the selected data. 
- We can refine selection by selecting similar elements to the one we initially indicated.
- **Column setting option**: it's represented by a cogwheel next to each column and allows to access this option to make individual edits or deletions to customize the final table to fit our needs. 
    - **Delete option:** Delete the extracted column.
    - **Parse data as**: this option allows to select between three main types of data: Text, Numbers, and Date & Time, and convert data from one type to another. 
    - **Sort**: this option allows to sort the data in columns by selecting 'Ascending' or 'Descending', depending on the requirement. 
    - **Sample after parsing**:  this option allows to preview the parsed data for a selected column. .
- **Extract data from multiple pages**:  by toggling this button to yes, you can indicate the next page navigation button or link to extract data from multiple pages. 
- **Settings Section**: it allows to set a limit for extraction by either 'Max Pages' or 'Max Rows', and by default, it's set to 'No Limit.'
