# Introduction to the Studio-Robot-Orchestrator ecosystem

1. **Studio**: tool for building automation processes.
2. **Robot**: runs the processes created in Studio, published in Orchestrator or locally.
3. **Orchestrator**: web application that acts as an interface between Studio and Robot and manages, controls and monitors automation tasks.
4. **Attended**: robots fired by humans to execute processes on their machines.
5. **Unattended**: robots deployed on separate machines that work without direct human intervention -> initiated and managed by Orchestrator.
