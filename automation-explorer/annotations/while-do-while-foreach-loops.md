# What are loops?

- Loops are an essential part of automation workflows, as they allow for repeating a set of operations based on a given condition.
- This can be useful for iterating through large sets of data, processing information, or executing certain tasks until a specific condition is met.
- The most important loops are: Do While, While and For Each

## Do While

- It executes a specific sequence while a condition is met. 
- The condition is evaluated after each execution of the statements. 

## While

- It executes a specific sequence while a condition is met. 
- The condition is evaluated before each execution of the statements.

## For Each

- It performs an activity or a series of activities on each element of an input collection.
- This is very useful in data processing.
