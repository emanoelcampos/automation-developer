# Global constants and global variables

- global constants and variables are containers that store data.
- these store data in a central location which can be accessed by all parts of an automation project.
- Global constants and variables can be created only from the Data Manger panel.

### How are they useful?

- It is sometimes necessary to share data between workflows in the same project. 
- With global constants and variables, this is possible without having to pass data as an argument.Â 
- Global constants and variables allow for greater flexibility as they can be easily accessed and modified as needed. This can help save time and simplify your automations.
