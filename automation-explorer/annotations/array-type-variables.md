# What are Collections?

- They're data types that allow the storage of multiple values of the same data type as a single collection.
- Each object in a collection can be identified by its index position.
- This allows us to work with all the objects in the collection simultaneously or each object individually depending on the requirement.

**StrArray = {"John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"}**

The first element is identified as follows:

**StrArray(0) = "John"**

- The beauty of a collection is that each object is dynamic and can change its value as the workflow is executed.

## What is an array? 

- An array variable or argument is a type that enables storing multiple values of the same data type. 
- Think of it as a group of elements with a size that is defined at creation, and where each item can be identified by its index.
- In Studio, you can create arrays of numbers, strings, Boolean values, and so on. All arrays are of fixed size and cannot be altered dynamically.
