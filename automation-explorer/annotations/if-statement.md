# Overview of the If statement

In UiPath Studio the If statement, or activity, consists of the following elements: 

- **Condition**—that's verified with two potential outcomes: true or false. This field only accepts Boolean expressions. 
- **Then branch**—the set of actions executed when the condition is true.
- **Optional Else branch**—the set of actions executed when the condition is false.

1. If statement can be used with a IF OPERATOR in VB
- if( (condition), TRUE, FALSE )
